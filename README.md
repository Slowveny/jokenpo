### In this project, you can play against my program by choosing a move: Rock, Paper, or Scissors!
## GOOD LUCK!

## Examples
```
Input
Enter your move (Rock/Paper/Scissors): Rok
```
```

Invalid move. Try again!
```
```

Enter your move (Rock/Paper/Scissors): Scissors
```

It's a TIE!
```

## Creation
#### To create this project, I used lists to store the possible moves in the game, `while` loops to keep the game running and to validate user input, conditional statements to determine the outcome of each round, and string manipulation. The result is a functional and user-friendly Rock-Paper-Scissors game that continues until the player chooses to exit!
